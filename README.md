Bash Bunny Windows 11 Scan Payload README
Introduction

This Bash Bunny payload is designed to scan a Windows 11 system for suspicious files or data and save all information of interest to the loot folder on the Bash Bunny's storage device. The payload runs by executing a series of cmd commands that generate output files containing information about the target system.

This README file provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the payload on a target Windows 11 system using a Bash Bunny.
Requirements

To use this payload, you will need the following:

    A Bash Bunny device
    A Windows 11 target system to scan
    Physical access to the target system to insert the Bash Bunny

Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Bash Bunny for running the Windows 11 scan payload:

    Insert the Bash Bunny into your computer's USB port.
    Navigate to the payloads folder on the Bash Bunny's storage device.
    Create a new folder called Windows11Scan inside the payloads folder.
    Inside the Windows11Scan folder, create a new file called switch1, without any file extension.
    Copy and paste the following code into the switch1 file:

LED FINISH

This code contains the Bash Bunny payload that performs the Windows 11 scan.

    Create a new folder called loot in the root directory of the Bash Bunny's storage device.

Running the Payload

To run the Windows 11 scan payload on a target system, follow these steps:

    Insert the Bash Bunny into an available USB port on the target Windows 11 system.
    Wait for the green LED on the Bash Bunny to turn off, indicating that the payload has finished executing.
    Remove the Bash Bunny from the USB port.
    Open the loot folder on the Bash Bunny's storage device to view the output files generated by the payload.

Output Files

The following files will be generated in the loot folder on the Bash Bunny's storage device:

    users.txt - contains a list of user accounts on the target system
    netstat.txt - contains a list of active network connections and associated processes
    tasklist.txt - contains a list of running processes and associated information
    systeminfo.txt - contains information about the target system, including hardware and operating system details.

Troubleshooting

If the payload does not seem to be running properly or generating output files, try the following:

    Ensure that the Bash Bunny is properly inserted into the target system's USB port and that the green LED turns off
